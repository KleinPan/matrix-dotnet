# matrix-dotnet

`matrix-dotnet` is a ✨modern✨ C# library for the matrix protocol focused on
code brevity. It features a two-layered approach with a Refit-based raw API
interface and a fully featured client class. Modern langauge features (like the
`goto` keyword) are used to make the code readable and succinct. Also we indent
with tabs.

### TODO

- Add code documentation
- Add functionality
